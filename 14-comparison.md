# Cost and Resource Management: Traditional vs Cloud Computing

## Traditional IT

- **CapEx:** Requires upfront investment in servers, storage, networking.
- **OpEx:** Ongoing costs for electricity, cooling, maintenance, upgrades.

## Cloud

- **OpEx:** Pay only for what you use, no hardware investments.
- **Scalability:** Easily increase/decrease resources.
- **Elasticity:** No need to over-provision for peak loads.

## Example Calculation

| Model         | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Scalability | Risk of Overprovisioning |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| On-Premises   | $50,000     | $2,000       | Low         | High                    |
| Cloud         | $0          | $2,000       | High        | Low                     |
